*A very persuasive package, for creating embroidery patterns.*

`ih` is a Python command-line tool for generating cross-stitch patterns from source images. 

Would you prefer to use a website instead? Try [`ih` as a Service](https://github.com/glasnt/ih-aas)

[As seen at PyCon US 2019](https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/229/)

## How to cross-stitch

Check out this amazing [Cross Stitch Carpentry](https://sgibson91.github.io/cross-stitch-carpentry/index.html) lesson!

## Installation

Requires [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):

### Printing

Use `--print-ready` for printing. `ih` will: 
 
 * Use print-css functionality to ensure the print view is black+white
 * Use js to dynamically split wide charts. *Requires* jQuery via CDN. 

When printing, the page order will be legend, then a series of columns of chart.
 
## Install from source

Using [`git`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/):

```
git clone git@github.com:glasnt/ih
cd ih
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
